# R
some simple statistic functions in R

up until now:

 - 3D Histogram for two series of equal length
 - Optimized version for 3D Histogram for two series of equal length, working for breaks = 2^n

came upon the necessity of using such a tool 
in the context of estimating entropy for the joint 
density distribution P(p,q) (momenta and position)
